# Farm layout optimization
# ========================
#
# This demo optimizes the position of 32 turbines in a tidal farm within a channel.
# The goal of the optimization is to maximise the farm's energy extraction. The
# rectangular channel is 640 m x 320 m large. The farm area is in the channel
# center and 320 m x 160 m large.

# It shows how to:
#   - set up a steady-state shallow water solver
#   - add a tidal farm with 32 turbines;
#   - define an optimisation objective, here the farm's power production;
#   - define an optimisation control, here the turbine positions;
#   - define constraints to the controls: bounds to restrict the positions
#     of the turbines to the farm bounds and minimum distance constraints
#     between each turbine;
#   - run the optimisation and retrieve the optimal turbine positions and farm
#     power production.

# Even though the domain in this demo is quite simple, the concept applies to
# more complex, realistic scenarios.
#
#
# The farm layout optimisation is initialized with a regular layout of 32 turbines:
#
# .. image:: 32turbines_regular.png
#     :scale: 30
#
#
# With this configuration, the flow speed with streamlines is:
#
# .. image:: 32turbines_regular_vel.png
#     :scale: 30
#
# The power extraction by the farm (without taking losses into account) is 46
# MW. This is 1.4 MW per turbine (32 turbines) which is unsatisfactory
# considering that placing a single turbine extracts 2.9 MW.
#
# We can also try a staggered layout:
#
# .. image:: 32turbines_staggered.png
#     :scale: 30
#
# With this configuration, the flow speed with streamlines is:
#
# .. image:: 32turbines_staggered_vel.png
#     :scale: 30
#
# The power extraction by the farm (without taking losses into account) is 64 MW
# or 2.0 MW per turbine. Thats better but still non-optimal.
#
# Applying the layout optimisation in OpenTidalFarm finishes after 92 iterations. The optimised farm layout is:
#
# .. image:: 32turbines_opt.png
#     :scale: 30
#
# The optimization has arranged the turbines to "barrages" perpendicular to the
# flow. Furthermore, it added small north and east barrages of turbines that
# force the water to flow through the prependicular "barrages". The associated
# flow speed with streamlines is:
#
# .. image:: 32turbines_opt_vel.png
#     :scale: 30
#
#
# The power production of the optimised layout is 80 MW, or 2.5 MW per turbine.
# That is the optimisation increased the power production by 74 % compared to
# the initial layout!

# Implementation
# **************
#

# The first part of the program sets up a steady state shallow water problem,
# and is nearly identical to the :ref:`channel_simulation` example:

from opentidalfarm import *

# Create a rectangular domain.
domain = FileDomain("mesh/mesh.xml")

# Specify boundary conditions.
bcs = BoundaryConditionSet()
bcs.add_bc("u", Constant((2, 0)), facet_id=1)
bcs.add_bc("eta", Constant(0), facet_id=2)
# The free-slip boundary conditions.
bcs.add_bc("u", facet_id=3, bctype="free_slip")

# Set the shallow water parameters
prob_params = SteadySWProblem.default_parameters()
prob_params.domain = domain
prob_params.bcs = bcs
prob_params.viscosity = Constant(2)
prob_params.depth = Constant(30)
prob_params.friction = Constant(0.0025)

# The next step is to create the turbine farm. In this case, the
# farm consists of 32 turbines, initially deployed in a regular grid layout.
# This layout will be the starting guess for the optimization.

# Before adding turbines we must specify the type of turbines used in the
# array.  Here we used the default BumpTurbine which defaults to being
# controlled by just position. The thrust_coefficient and diameter are set and
# a minimum distance between each turbine is specified. (if no minimum distance
# is set, it defaults to 1.5*diameter).
turbine = BumpTurbine(diameter=20.0, thrust_coefficient=0.8, minimum_distance=25,
        depth=prob_params.depth)

# A rectangular farm is defined using the domain and the site dimensions.
farm = RectangularFarm(domain, site_x_start=160, site_x_end=480,
                       site_y_start=80, site_y_end=240, turbine=turbine)

# Turbines are then added to the site in a regular grid layout.
farm.add_regular_turbine_layout(num_x=8, num_y=4)

prob_params.tidal_farm = farm

# Now we can create the shallow water problem

problem = SteadySWProblem(prob_params)

# Next we create a shallow water solver. Here we choose to solve the shallow
# water equations in its fully coupled form. We also set the dump period to 1 in
# order to save the results of each optimisation iteration to disk.

sol_params = CoupledSWSolver.default_parameters()
sol_params.dump_period = 1
solver = CoupledSWSolver(problem, sol_params)

# Next we create a reduced functional, that is the functional considered as a
# pure function of the control by implicitly solving the shallow water equations. For
# that we need to specify the objective functional (the value that we want to
# optimize), the control (the variables that we want to change), and our shallow
# water solver.

functional = PowerFunctional(problem)
control = TurbineFarmControl(farm)
rf_params = ReducedFunctional.default_parameters()
rf_params.automatic_scaling = 5
rf = ReducedFunctional(functional, control, solver, rf_params)

# As always, we can print all options of the :class:`ReducedFunctional` with:

print rf_params

# Now we can define the constraints for the controls and start the
# optimisation.

# If no minimum distance constrained for the turbines is required, we can use
# the L-BFGS-B optimisation method:

lb, ub = farm.site_boundary_constraints()
f_opt = maximize(rf, bounds=[lb, ub], method="L-BFGS-B",
                 options={'maxiter': 100, 'ftol': 1e-05})

# Otherwise, we need to create the minimum distance constraints and pass them to
# an optimisation method that supports such constraints (here we use SLSQP):

# .. code-block:: python

#    lb, ub = farm.site_boundary_constraints()
#    ieq = farm.minimum_distance_constraints()
#    f_opt = maximize(rf, bounds=[lb, ub], constraints=ieq, method="SLSQP",
#                     options={'maxiter': 100, 'ftol': 1e-03})


# How to run the example
# **********************

# The example code can be found in ``examples/channel-optimization/`` in the
# ``OpenTidalFarm`` source tree, and executed as follows:

# .. code-block:: bash

#   $ python channel-optimization.py

# You can speed up the calculation by using multiple cores (in this case 4) with:

# .. code-block:: bash

#   $ mpirun -n 4 python channel-optimization.py

# During the optimization run, OpenTidalFarm creates multiple files for
# inspection:
#
# *  turbines.pvd: Stores the position and friction values of the turbines at
#    each optimisation iteration.
# *  iter_*: For each optimisation iteration X, the associated
#    velocity and pressure solutions are stored in a directory named iter_X.
# *  iterate.dat: A testfile that dumps the optimisation progress, e.g. number of
#    iterations, function value, gradient norm, etc
#
# The pvd files can be opened with the open-source software
# `Paraview <http://www.paraview.org>`_.
